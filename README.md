  ## Description / Objective
  Zentechi is a technology blog site. It is designed to be a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and also comment on other developersâ€™ posts. This site was built and deployed to Heroku. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
